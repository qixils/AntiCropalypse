            The aCropalypse vulnerability (CVE-2023-21036) has lit the internet ablaze with fear over the mounds of
            screenshots uploaded to social media websites over the past several years that could potentially contain
            private information like phone numbers, addresses, and even banking information. While many social media
            platforms reprocess images after uploading (and thus accidentally mitigate the vulnerability), Discord did
            not do so until January 2023, leaving potentially millions of vulnerable screenshots on the platform open
            for anyone to grab.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enter AntiCropalypse, an <a href="https://github.com/qixils/anticropalypse">open-source</a> Discord bot that
            mitigates the aCropalypse vulnerability by retroactively deleting vulnerable images. In only a few minutes,
            server admins can install and set up the bot to have it off on its merry way happily deleting and archiving
            vulnerable images. Once it's complete, the bot will report on the tally of vulnerable images and give every
            affected user instructions on how to download their archived (and fixed!) images.
        </p>

        <h2>How aCropalypse Works</h2>
        <p>
            The aCropalypse vulnerability is a result of how cropped screenshots are saved to a device. The issue was
            first discovered on Google Pixel devices where a regression in Android 10 meant that, when overwriting an
            existing file (say, the original uncropped screenshot), the original file would not get fully overwritten.
            This meant that every time you cropped or edited a screenshot on a Google Pixel, it would only partially
            overwrite the original file, leaving a ton of the original image's data in the final file. This data could
            then be recovered by a malicious actor, allowing them to access whatever part of the image you tried to crop
            or edit out: names, phone numbers, addresses, et cetera.
        </p>
        <p>
            This vulnerability has also been found to affect screenshots taken on the Windows 10+ Snip & Sketch and the
            Windows 11 Snipping Tool, although to a much lesser extent. Since the issue arises from saving files, one
            would need to have snipped and saved a screenshot, then decided they wanted to crop it further and save it
            again.

                With thanks to retr0id who wrote up an excellent
                <a href="https://www.da.vidbuchanan.co.uk/blog/exploiting-acropalypse.html">article</a>
                for developers to learn more about the vulnerability.

        </p>
        <p>
            To tell if an image is vulnerable, AntiCropalypse starts by parsing the image like any other PNG parser
            would by iterating through all its chunks and stopping once it reaches the "IEND" of the file. Unlike a
            normal PNG parser, it then checks to see if there is any excess data at the end of the file. If so, it
            tries to continue parsing and decoding these PNG chunks. If this proceeds without any errors, then the bot
            can safely determine that two images are contained within the file (one the cropped screenshot, the other
            the original image) and flags the message for archival and deletion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bot performs this check on every attachment and image link in every message in every channel in a
            server. When it finds a vulnerable image, it safely archives the message and its (fixed!) image attachments
            to a private cloud server and then deletes the message. Once it's finished scanning the whole server, it
            reports back to the user who started the scan with the tally of vulnerable messages and then informs every
            affected user of the vulnerability and how to download their archived images.
