# anticropalypse

Discord bot which searches for and deletes images vulnerable to the Acropalypse exploit (CVE-2023-21036).
The public bot can be invited here: (TBD; not complete enough to my liking)

## Usage

Compile the bot with `./gradlew build`,
set the `BOT_TOKEN` environment variable,
and run it with `java -jar bot/build/libs/anticropalypse-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
